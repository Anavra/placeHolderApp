Android App TDP028

Description
---------------

The point of this app is to have an inventory for things that you may forget you have. Have you ever put a lot of miscellaneous objects in a few boxes, labeled the boxes, but it's never too clear what's in the boxes unless you look?

This information can be saved instead in an app, and it will allow you to search for the item. For example if you want a black sharpie marker, you can search for it and find out in which container it belongs and even in which room of the house this container is placed.

This means that you have to register your rooms, containers and objects first. You can choose specific icons to easily see which kind of room, container or object it is. You can also add pictures of the object, descriptions and other information.

You can even link some items so they can be shown as "Related items".
